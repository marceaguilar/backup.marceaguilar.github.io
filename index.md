Welcome! 
I am a Ph.D student in Business and Accounting at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). 

My research areas of interest are enterprise, entrepreneurship, and informal economy in developing countries. My current research project is on business practices and performance of small and micro business in Latin America. 

My previous academic background includes a MA in Economics from Duke University (NC, USA) and a Bachelor in Economics from Central American University (Nicaragua).

Outside of academia, I have worked in commercial and investment banking in Latin America, where my primary responsibilities included investment portfolio and liquidity management.
