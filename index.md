Welcome! 
I am a Ph.D student in Business and Accounting at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). 

My research areas of interest are enterprise, entrepreneurship, public policy, and informal economy in developing countries. My current research project is on practices and performance of small and micro business in Latin America. 

My previous academic background includes a master in Economics and Public Policy at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) (UK) and a Bachelor in Economics from [Central American University](https://uca.edu.sv/) (El Salvador). I also studied mathematics at the [National University of El Salvador](https://www.ues.edu.sv/)

Outside of academia, I have worked with the United Nations in UNICEF and ILO at Italy and Central America. I also worked with the Chambers of Commerce and Organizations of Employers in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
